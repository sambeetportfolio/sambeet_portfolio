Learning is objectively an activity that most of us start early. A toodler learns how to interact with environment, so is an adult. The learning process for an adult is typically faster through reasoning. The reasoning process can be categorized into three types:

- Inductive: specific cases to determine general outcomes, e.g. specific to general
- Deductive: deduction is going from the general to the specific
- Transactive: predicting specific examples given specific examples from a domain

The transition from no to little; then little to too much information in the current day brings forward new challenges such as how to verify the originality. In Vedantaic (Indian literature) philosophy, it is described that there are multiple truths that co-exist. At first it may sound confusing. However, it makes sense if we take a truth in the context of time and space. Then the question arises of of absolute truth. Is there an absolute truth? Well, it does and then it does not. Simply speaking, every absolute truth is temporary since the viewer itself is temporary.
