Learning is objectively an activity that most of us start early. A toodler learns how to interact with environment, so is an adult. The learning process for an adult is typically faster through reasoning. The reasoning process can be categorized into three types:

- Inductive: specific cases to determine general outcomes, e.g. specific to general
- Deductive: deduction is going from the general to the specific
- Transactive: predicting specific examples given specific examples from a domain
